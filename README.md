# Nature-Foundation

We build an app for a NGO, named Work With Nature that aims to converse at least 2000ha of rainforest in Costa Rica. 

The app visualizes the adoption of square meters of rain forest in their reserve for the donors. Donors will be able to log in 
and see what's going on in the forest
